        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering major with experience in full-stack mobile development, Java, and XML. My experience in software development includes an internship at Boeing performing computer simulations on proposed missile defense architectures and 3 Android apps I have developed, published, and updated on the Google Play Store. Iâ€™m looking for an internship where I can gain practical experience while also improving my own software development skills.</p>
